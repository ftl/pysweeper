# pysweeper
This is a simple GUI for the antenna analyzer kit provided by [Heribert/DK2JK](http://dk2jk.darc.de/arduino/index_arduino.html). The whole thing is written in Python 2.7 using [PySide](http://www.pyside.org/), [PyQtGraph](http://pyqtgraph.org/) and [pySerial](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyserial/). As I'm developing this on Linux, I cannot say anything about other OSs.

## Usage

	python pysweeper.py
